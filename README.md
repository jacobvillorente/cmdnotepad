# what is this

chances are, if you're reading this, you're more than likely a coworker or manager (or god forbit an IT manager)(in that case hi, my resume is in my bag i'm happy to give it to you) of mine and stumbled across this page. hello! i'm jacob, i'm a scribe tech at citymd, and one of my hobbies is computer science. 

i made this file because there have been times where i need to chart or document something and either athena isn't loading or notepad is giving me problems. there are times where i can't wait for athena, and not documenting a patient's visit could severely and detrimentally compromise patient care (e.g., rush backs for patients in severe or critical condition, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, actively bleeding lacerations, severe pain) or in cases where there is not yet a chart for the patient (e.g. change in reason for visit, issues with insurance, athena just randomly deleting charts, accidental deletions of charts). this code is essentially a note pad run directly within the browser. 

## is this hipaa compliant?

more likely than not, yes. **it's the same as documenting on a post-it note or napkin, then shredding the document once finished.** this code is run purely locally, since all the code necessary to run this program is in the search bar. the method of running this code does not allow for any scripts to be run, meaning nothing can be saved, with or without the user's consent. nothing directly or indirectly generated from this specific program phishes, tracks, or monitors anything. the only time anything can be saved is if someone:
- prints out what's typed on this page
- saves as a file what's typed on this page
- copies and pastes anything that's on this page

in other words, the only time anything can be saved is if something actually does something to save the text they type somewhere. 

## why make this?

because it is insanely easier to push a button in my bookmarks than search for the notepad app and hope that it works.
